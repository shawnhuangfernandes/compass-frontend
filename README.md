# COMPASS FRONT-END APPLICATION

## Overview

Compass is a full-stack application I built as part of Flatiron's software engineering program. It is supposed to be a simple education curriculum web application centered around life purpose. It consists of a front-end (built using React) and back-end (built using Rails). It was built over the course of a week as an educational excercise to build my very first full stack application.

## Requirements

For development, you will need 
- Node.js

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

    $ node --version
    v0.10.24

    $ npm --version
    1.3.21

## Install & Run
    **Front End**
    $ git clone git@github.com:shawnhuangfernandes/compass-frontend.git
    $ cd PROJECT
    $ npm install

    **Back End**
    $ git clone git@github.com:shawnhuangfernandes/compass-backend.git
    $ cd PROJECT
    $ bundle install
    $ rails s

    **Keep in mind that the code is written assuming the backend uses a root url of http://localhost:3000/**
    **Be sure to run the backend rails server located at https://github.com/shawnhuangfernandes/compass-backend**
